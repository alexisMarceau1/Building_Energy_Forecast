# Seattle_prediction

This project aims to predict the energy consumption `SiteEnergyUse(kBtu)` and CO2 emissions `TotalGHGEmissions` of Seattle's non-residential buildings using 2015 and 2016 data. 

In Seattle's context of aiming for carbon neutrality by 2050, this type of prediction would enable companies to reduce the costs associated with data collection while improving their ability to monitor and optimize the energy performance of their buildings.

We will also assess whether the `ENERGYSTARScore`, which is costly to calculate, can be omitted in emission predictions without compromising accuracy.
